The office in Cyprus has expanded and contains all the infrastructure for driving both
outgoing telemarketing and customer service centers.

Televinken now offers a unique concept where companies can rent at Televinken's office for a whole department or single team.

The concept is that Televinken Ltd hires appointed staff and manages the operation of, for example, a customer service. Televinken provides the entire infrastructure such as,
workplace, computer, internet, IP telephony. Televink also provides office manager who ensures that
staff are taken care of, make sure to settle housing, bank accounts etc. in order to smoothly
